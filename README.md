# Simon-JS

### A classic Simon Game Simplified

# To run:

Click the clone or download dropdown in github

Download as zip

Extract onto your desktop

Run the index.html file

# Notes on Use:
Start the game and watch the sequence.
After the sequence is finished try to match it by clicking the corresponding buttons.
Each new sequence will add a new random button choice to the existing sequence.
When you get 20 in a row you win!
If you don't get the sequence right the same sequence will be replayed and you can try again.

Hardcore Mode: 
If you mess up a sequence the game will reset, back to 1, and you will have to start over.

Random Mode:
Each new sequence will be made of totally random button choices rather than building on the previous sequence.
